**Welcome to Aspose.Email for C++**

Aspose.Eamil for C++ is a native C++ library that enables C++ developers to create, manipulate and convert Outlook and other popular emailing file formats. The API is independent of Office Automation or MS Outlook, and doesn't need these to be installed on the server.

The API can be used on Windows OS for working with emailing file formats.
