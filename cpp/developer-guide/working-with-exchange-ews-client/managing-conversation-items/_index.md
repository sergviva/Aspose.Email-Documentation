Aspose.Email can be used to manage the conversation items on Exchange Server with the [EWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/cpp/email/class/aspose.email.clients.exchange.web_service.e_w_s_client/) class. This class uses Exchange Web Services, which are only available in Exchange Server 2007 and later releases. This article shows how to find, copy, move and delete conversation items on Exchange Server 2010. Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 1 is required for all the features included in this section.
