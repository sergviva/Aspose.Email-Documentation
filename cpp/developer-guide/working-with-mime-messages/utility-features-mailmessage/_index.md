## **MailMessages Containing TNEF attachments**
Transport Neutral Encapsulation Format (TNEF) is a proprietary email attachment format used by Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange Server. The Aspose.Email API allows you to read email messages that have TNEF attachments and modify the contents of the attachment. The email can then be saved as normal email or to the same format, preserving TNEF attachments. This article shows different code samples for working with messages containing TNEF attachments. This article also shows working with creating TNEF EML files from Outlook MSG files.
