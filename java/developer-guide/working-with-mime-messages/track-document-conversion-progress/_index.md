## **Track Document Conversion Progress**
Aspose.Email provides the facility to track the document conversion progress. For this, the API provides [SaveOptions.CustomProgressHandler](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/SaveOptions#setCustomProgressHandler\(com.aspose.email.ConversionProgressEventHandler\)). which represents the method that handles the progress events. The progress event types are represented by the [ProgressEventType](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ProgressEventType) enumeration. The [ProgressEventType](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ProgressEventType) enumeration has the following members.

- [MimeStructureCreated](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ProgressEventType#MimeStructureCreated): This event informs that the mime structure is created.
- [MimePartSaved](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ProgressEventType#MimePartSaved): This event informs that saving of one mime part is finished.
- [SavedToStream](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ProgressEventType#SavedToStream): This event informs that all mime parts are saved to stream.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of [SaveOptions.CustomProgressHandler](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/SaveOptions#setCustomProgressHandler\(com.aspose.email.ConversionProgressEventHandler\)) and [ProgressEventType](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ProgressEventType) enumeration track the document conversion progress.
