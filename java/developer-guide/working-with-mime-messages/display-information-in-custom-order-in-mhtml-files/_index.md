Aspose.Email provides [MhtSaveOptions.RenderingHeaders](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mhtsaveoptions/properties/renderingheaders) property which returns the list of headers for rendering. You can add the headers by using the [MhtTemplateName](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mhttemplatename) class. The order in which the headers are added decides the order in which the information is displayed.

The following image compares the three outputs generated by the sample code.
