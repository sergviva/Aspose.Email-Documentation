You can move email messages from one folder to another with the help of the [ExchangeClient.moveMessage()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ExchangeClient#moveMessage\(com.aspose.email.ExchangeMessageInfo,%20java.lang.String\)) method. It takes the parameters:

- The unique URI of the message which is to be moved.
- The unique URI of the destination folder.
## **Move Messages between Folders**
The sample code below that moves a message in a mailbox from the Inbox folder to a folder called Processed. In this example, the application:

1. Reads messages from the Inbox folder.
1. Processes some of the messages based on some criteria (in this example, we find a keyword in the message subject).
1. Moves messages which fulfill the given condition to the Processed folder.
