## **Using EmailValidator**
[EmailValidator](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/EmailValidator) provides full support for validating email addresses. With the help of the [EmailValidator](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/EmailValidator) class, different types of validation can be performed, including email syntax checking, email domain checking and checking user accounts with mail servers. The [ValidationPolicy](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/java/com.aspose.email/ValidationPolicy) enumeration is used to set the validation policy level:

- SyntaxOnly validates the email address syntax.
- SyntaxAndDomain validates the email address syntax, then validate the domain.
## **Basic Validation Functionality**

EmailValidator ev = new EmailValidator();
ValidationResult[] result = new ValidationResult[] { null };
ev.validate("user@domain.com", result);

}
