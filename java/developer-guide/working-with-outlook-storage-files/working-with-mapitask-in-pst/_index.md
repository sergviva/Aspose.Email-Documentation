## **Adding MapiTask to PST**
[Create New PST, Add Sub-folders and Messages](/email/java/create-new-pst-add-sub-folders-and-messages/) showed how to create a PST file and add a subfolder to it. With Aspose.Email you can add MapiTask to the Tasks subfolder of a PST file that you have created or loaded.

Below are the steps to add MapiTask to a PST:

1. Create a [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/MapiTask) object.
1. Set the [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/MapiTask) properties using constructor and different methods.
1. Create a PST using the [PersonalStorage.create()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/PersonalStorage#create\(java.io.OutputStream,%20int\)) method.
1. Create a pre-defined folder (Tasks) at the root of the PST file by accessing the Root folder and then calling the [addMapiMessageItem()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/FolderInfo#addMapiMessageItem\(com.aspose.email.IMapiMessageItem\)) method.

The code snippet below shows how to create a [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/MapiTask) and then add it to the Tasks folder of a newly created PST file.
