## **About AMP**
AMP(Accelerated Mobile Pages) is an open-source framework by Google created from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It enables building lightweight emails with faster load times. AMP provides many components like carousels, forms, images, etc. Along with being fast, AMP Emails renders fully interactive emails inside the email client and the customers can interact with the emails directly like filling a form or responding to a survey without leaving the email client.
## **Working with AMP HTML Emails**
Aspose.Email provides the [AmpMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/AmpMessage) that represents an AMP Email. Aspose.Email provides many classes to add components to AMP Emails like [AmpImage](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/AmpImage), [AmpCarousel](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/AmpCarousel), [AmpAccordion](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/AmpAccordion), [AmpForm](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/AmpForm), etc. The following code snippet demonstrates creating, saving, and updating AMP Emails using Aspose.Email API.
