## **Introduction to Aspose.Email Java for PHP**
### **PHP / Java Bridge**
The PHP/Java Bridge is an implementation of a streaming, XML-based [network protocol](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/PROTOCOL.TXT), which can be used to connect a native script engine, for example PHP, Scheme or Python, with a Java virtual machine. It is up to 50 times faster than local RPC via SOAP, requires less resources on the web-server side. It is [faster](http://php-java-bridge.sourceforge.net/pjb/FAQ.html#performance) and more reliable than direct communication via the Java Native Interface, and it requires no additional components to invoke Java procedures from PHP or PHP procedures from Java.

### **How to configure the source code on Linux Platform**
Please follow these simple steps in order to open and extend the source code while using:
### **1. Install Tomcat Server**
To install tomcat server, issue following command on the linux console. This will successfully install tomcat server. 

``` actionscript3

 sudo apt-get install tomcat8

```
### **2. Download and Configure PHP/JavaBridge**
In order to download the PHP/JavaBridge binaries, issue following command on the linux console. 

``` actionscript3

  wget http://citylan.dl.sourceforge.net/project/php-java-bridge/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip 

```


Unzip the PHP/JavaBridge binaries by issuing the following command on linux console. 

``` actionscript3

  unzip -d php-java-bridge_6.2.1_documentation.zip 

```


This will extract **JavaBridge.war** file. Copy it to tomcat88 **webapps** folder by issuing the following command on Linux console. 

``` actionscript3

  sudo cp JavaBridge.war /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/JavaBridge.war 

```


By copying, tomcat8 will automatically create a new folder "**JavaBridge**" in **webapps**. Once the folder is created, make sure your tomcat8 is running and then check <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge> in browser, it should open a default page of JavaBridge. 

If any error message appears then install  **FastCGI** by issuing the following command on Linux console.

``` actionscript3

  sudo apt-get install php55-cgi 

```

After installing php5.5 cgi, restart tomcat8 server and check <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge> again in the browser.

If **JAVA_HOME** error is displayed, then open /etc/default/tomcat8 file and uncomment the line that sets the JAVA_HOME. Check <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge> in browser again, it should come with PHP/JavaBridge Examples page. 
### **3. Configure Aspose.Email Java for PHP Examples**
Clone, PHP examples by issuing the following commands inside webapps/JavaBridge folder.  

``` actionscript3

 $ git init&nbsp;

$ git clone [https://github.com/asposeslides/Aspose.Email-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose.Email-for-Java_for_PHP] 

```

### **How to configure the source code on Windows Platform**
Please follow below simple steps to configure PHP/Java Bridge on Windows Platform

1. Install PHP5 and configure as you normally do
2. Install JRE 6 (Java Runtime Environment) if you don’t already have it. You can check this in C:\Program Files etc. You can download it here . I am using JRE 6 as It is compatible with PHP Java Bridge (PJB).

3. Install Apache Tomcat 8.0. You can download it here

4.Download [JavaBridge.war](http://sourceforge.net/projects/php-java-bridge/files/Binary%20package/php-java-bridge_6.2.1/JavaBridgeTemplate621.war/download). Copy this file to tomcat webapps directory.
(ex: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps )

5. Restart tomcat apache service.

6.Go to <http://localhost:8080/JavaBridge/test.php> to check if php works. You can find other examples in there

7.Copy your [Aspose.Email Java](http://www.aspose.com/community/files/72/java-components/aspose.email-for-java/default.aspx) jar file to C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\WEB-INF\lib

8. Clone [Aspose.Email Java for PHP](https://github.com/aspose-email/Aspose.Email-for-Java/tree/master/Plugins/Aspose_Email_Java_for_PHP) examples inside C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\ folder.

8. Copy folder C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 8.0\webapps\JavaBridge\java to your Aspose.Email Java for PHP examples folder.

\10. Restart apache tomcat service and start using examples.
