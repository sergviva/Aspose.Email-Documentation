# Utility Features - SMTP Client
## **Listing Extension Servers using Smtp Client**
Aspose.Email's [SmtpClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient) lets you retrieve the server extensions that a server supports such as IDLE, UNSELECT, QUOTA, etc. This helps in identifying the availability of an extension before using the client for that particular functionality. The [GetCapabilities()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/methods/getcapabilities) method returns the supported extension types in the form of a string array.
### **Retrieving Server Extensions**
The following code snippet shows you how to retrieve server extensions.

## **Working with Signed Message**
Aspose.Email API provides the capability to create Signed messages using certificates. The [AttachSignature](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mailmessage/methods/attachsignature/index) method of the [MailMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mailmessage) class can be used to sign a message for saving or even sending it using the [SmtpClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient).
### **Sign a Message**

### **Using Detached Certificate Option**
Web-based email clients may not be able to display body contents of a Signed message. This can be taken care of by detaching the certificate before sending it to web-based email clients. The detached flag in the overloaded method of [AttachSignature](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mailmessage/methods/attachsignature/index) can be used to achieve this. If set to **true**, the certificate is detached from the email and vice versa. To see Signed Message body in Web-based clients, you need to create [MailMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mailmessage) with detached signature. The following code snippet shows you how to use detached certificate option.
