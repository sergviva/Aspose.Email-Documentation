## **SMTP Client Activity Logging**
SMTP client activity can be logged by modifying the configSections in the config file. Following are the steps to perform diagnostics logging:

- Add a sectionGroup called "applicationSettings".
- Add a section called "Aspose.Email.Properties.Settings".
- Include the setting with the name SmtpDiagonosticLog where the file name is defined in the applicationSettings/Aspose.Email.Properties.Settings

Here is a sample form based application which uses [SmtpClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.smtp/smtpclient) to send an email. This whole activity is logged by modifying the App.config file. Create a form application with a single button on it. Add the following code for button’s click:



{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "6e5185a63aec6fd70d83098e82b06a32" "Examples-CSharp-SMTP-SMTPClientActivityLogging-SMTPClientActivityLogging.cs" >}}



- Add reference to Aspose.Email.
