## **About IBM Notes**
IBM Notes is the client and IBM Domino is the server of a collaborative client-server software platform. IBM Notes provides collaboration features like email, calendars, to-do lists, contacts management, etc. The database file used by IBM Notes is saved in the Notes Storage Facility (NSF) format.
## **Read messages from NSF storage file**
Aspose.Email provides the [NotesStorageFacility](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.nsf/notesstoragefacility) class to read NSF storage files. The [NotesStorageFacility](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.nsf/notesstoragefacility) class provides the [EnumerateMessages](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.nsf/notesstoragefacility/methods/enumeratemessages) method which iterates over the messages in the NSF storage file. The following sample code demonstrates the use of the [NotesStorageFacility](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.nsf/notesstoragefacility) class and the [EnumerateMessages](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.nsf/notesstoragefacility/methods/enumeratemessages) method to read messages from the NSF storage file.
