#### 5. Allowing permissions for Microsoft Graph API.

Click on the **API permissions** label.

Azure has already given you **User.Read** delegated permissions for your application. This permission will allow us to read user information for a logged in user. These are Microsoft Graph API permissions, in other hand we can call them as **Scopes**.

The full list of scopes for Microsoft Graph API - <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/permissions-reference>.

Click on **+ Add a permission** button and select **Microsoft Graph**.

Click on **Delegated permissions**. Now you see a list of permissions available for Microsoft Graph API.

Select required permissions, click **Add permissions** button.

Click **Grant admin consent** button.
