## **Adding MapiTask to PST**
[Create a New PST File and Add Subfolders](/email/net/create-new-pst-file-and-add-subfolders/#creating-a-new-pst-file-and-add-subfolders) showed how to create a PST file and add a subfolder to it. With Aspose.Email you can add [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask) to the Tasks subfolder of a PST file that you have created or loaded. Below are the steps to add MapiTask to a PST:

1. Create a [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask) object.
1. Set the [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask) properties using constructor and different methods.
1. Create a PST using the [PersonalStorage.Create()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/methods/create/index) method.
1. Create a pre-defined folder (Tasks) at the root of the PST file by accessing the Root folder and then calling the [AddMapiMessageItem()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/methods/addmapimessageitem) method.

The following code snippet shows you how to create a [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask) and then add it to the tasks folder of a newly created PST file.
