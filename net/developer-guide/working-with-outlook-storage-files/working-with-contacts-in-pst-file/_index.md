## **Adding Contact to PST**
[Create a New PST File and Add Subfolders](/email/net/create-new-pst-file-and-add-subfolders/#creating-a-new-pst-file-and-add-subfolders) showed how to create a PST file and add a subfolder to it. With Aspose.Email you can add a MapiContact to the Contacts subfolder of a PST file that you have created or loaded. Below are the steps to add MapiContact to a PST:

1. Create a [MapiContact](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapicontact) object.
1. Set the [MapiContact properties](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.mapi/mapicontact/properties/index) using different constructors and methods.
1. Create a PST using the [PersonalStorage.Create()](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/personalstorage/methods/create/index) method.
1. Create a pre-defined folder (Contacts) at the root of the PST file by accessing the root folder and then calling the [AddMapiMessageItem()](https://apireference.aspose.com/email/net/aspose.email.storage.pst/folderinfo/methods/addmapimessageitem) method.

The following code snippet shows you how to create a MapiContact and then add it to the contacts folder of a newly created PST file.
