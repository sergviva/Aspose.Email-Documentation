1. Create a meeting request using the [Appointment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.calendar/appointment) class and set the location, time and attendees.
1. Create an instance of the [MailMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mailmessage) class and set the appointment using the [MailMessage.AddAlternateView()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/mailmessage/methods/addalternateview) method.
1. Connect to the Exchange Server and send the meeting request using the Send(MailMessage) method.

This example uses the [ExchangeClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.dav/exchangeclient) class, which uses the [WebDAV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebDAV) protocol to connect to the Exchange Server and can be used with any version of Exchange Server on which WebDAV is enabled, for example Exchange 2000, 2003 or 2007.
