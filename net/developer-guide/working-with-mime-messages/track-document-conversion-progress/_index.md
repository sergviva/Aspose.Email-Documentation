Aspose.Email provides the facility to track the document conversion progress. For this, the API provides [SaveOptions.CustomProgressHandler](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/saveoptions/properties/customprogresshandler). which represents the method that handles the progress events. The progress event types are represented by the [ProgressEventType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/progresseventtype) enumeration. The [ProgressEventType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/progresseventtype) enumeration has the following members.

- MimeStructureCreated: This event informs that the mime structure is created.
- MimePartSaved: This event informs that saving of one mime part is finished.
- SavedToStream: This event informs that all mime parts are saved to stream.

The following sample code demonstrates the use of [SaveOptions.CustomProgressHandler](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/saveoptions/properties/customprogresshandler) and [ProgressEventType](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email/progresseventtype) enumeration track the document conversion progress.
