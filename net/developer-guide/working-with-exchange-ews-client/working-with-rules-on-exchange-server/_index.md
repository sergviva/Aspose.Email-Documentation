## **Managing Rules**
Aspose.Email for .NET can be used to manage the rules on Exchange Server using the [EWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice/ewsclient) class. This class uses Exchange Web Services (EWS), which are available in Exchange Server 2007 and later releases. To show how to manage rules, this article explains how to:

- Read the rules already on the server.
- Create a new rule.
- Update an existing rule.

Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 1 is required for all features described in this article.
### **Read Rules**
To get all the rules from the Exchange Server:

1. Connect to an Exchange Server using the [IEWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice/iewsclient) class.
1. Call the [IEWSClient.GetInboxRules()](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice/iewsclient/methods/getinboxrules) method to get all the rules.
1. In a foreach loop, browse through all the rules and display the rule properties like conditions, actions, and name.

The following code snippet shows you how to read rules.
