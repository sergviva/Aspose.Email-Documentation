Aspose.Email supports accessing messages from the shared mailbox. To achieve this, you connect to your primary mailbox by using the [EWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice/ewsclient) class. To access messages from the shared mailbox, you pass the shared mailbox as a string parameter to the [ListMessages](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice.iewsclient/listmessages/methods/13) or [ListItems](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice.iewsclient/listitems/methods/3) method.

The following code sample shows how to access messages from the shared mailbox using the [ListItems](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice.iewsclient/listitems/methods/3) method.
