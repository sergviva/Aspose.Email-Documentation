## **Adding Contacts**
The EWSClient class CreateContact() method can be used to add Contact information to an Exchange Server. The CreateContact() method takes a Contact object as an input parameter.

To add contacts to an Exchange Server:

1. Initialize the EWSClient with address and credentials.
1. Initialize the Contact object with the desired properties.
1. Call the CreateContact method to add the contact to the Exchange Server.

Aspose.Email provides the [EWSClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.exchange.webservice/ewsclient) class to connect to Microsoft Exchange Server using Exchange Web Services. The code snippets shows you how to follow use Exchange Web Services to add contacts to an Exchange Server.

To delete contacts from an Exchange Server:

1. Initialize the ExchangeWebServiceClient with address and credentials.
1. Delete a contact using its ID.
1. Delete a contact by calling the DeleteContact method with MapiContact as input parameter.

The following code snippets shows you how to deleting contacts from an exchange server using exchange web service.

## **Working with Extended Properties of Contacts on Exchange Server**


``` cs

 IEWSClient client = EWSClient.GetEWSClient("https://outlook.office365.com/ews/exchange.asmx", "testUser", "pwd", "domain");

//The required extended properties must be added in order to create or read them from the Exchange Server

string[] extraFields = new string[] {{ "User Field 1", "User Field 2", "User Field 3", "User Field 4" }};

foreach (string extraField in extraFields)

    client.ContactExtendedPropertiesDefinition.Add(extraField);

//Create a test contact on the Exchange Server

Contact contact = new Contact();

contact.DisplayName = "EMAILNET-38433 - " + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

foreach (string extraField in extraFields)

    contact.ExtendedProperties.Add(extraField, extraField);

string contactId = client.CreateContact(contact);

//retrieve the contact back from the server after some time

Thread.Sleep(5000);

contact = client.GetContact(contactId);

//Parse the extended properties of contact

foreach (string extraField in extraFields)

    if (contact.ExtendedProperties.ContainsKey(extraField))

        Console.WriteLine(contact.ExtendedProperties[extraField].ToString());

```
