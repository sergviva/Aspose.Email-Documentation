## **IMAP Backup and Restore Operation with MultiConnection**
When working with a large number of messages, the backup/restore operation can take a long time. For this, the API provides support for multiple connections during backup and restore operation. To enable the MultiConnection mode, set [ImapClient.UseMultiConnection](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients/emailclient/properties/usemulticonnection) property to [MultiConnectionMode.Enable](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients/multiconnectionmode). The following code snippets demonstrate backup and restore operation with MultiConnection mode enabled.
