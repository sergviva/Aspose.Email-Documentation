[ImapClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.imap/imapclient) activity can be logged by modifying the configSections in the config file. Following are the steps to perform diagnostics logging:

1. Add a **sectionGroup** called "applicationSettings".
1. Add a **section** called "Aspose.Email.Properties.Settings".
1. Include the setting ImapDiagonosticLog where the file name is defined in the **applicationSettings/Aspose.Email.Properties.Settings**.

Here is a sample form application which uses [ImapClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.clients.imap/imapclient) to process mail. This whole activity is logged by modifying the App.config file.

- Create a form based application with a single button on it. Add the following sample code for button's click:



{{< gist "aspose-com-gists" "6e5185a63aec6fd70d83098e82b06a32" "Examples-CSharp-IMAP-ImapClientActivityLogging-ImapClientActivityLogging.cs" >}}



- Add a reference to Aspose.Email.
