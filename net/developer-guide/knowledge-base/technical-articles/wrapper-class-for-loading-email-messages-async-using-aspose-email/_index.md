## **Wrapper class for loading Email Messages**
There are a number of occurrences where it is desirable to have Time out functionality in order to abort an action that is taking unnecessary long time. This article provides a sample class to achieve the functionality of Time out functionality while loading EML/MSG files that could lead to very long delays or fail to load. Since Time out is not something directly related to disk or network read/write operation, it’s of little use to implement this feature within the API than have it implemented at the user end by writing a wrapper class around Aspose.

Canceling a long running thread can be achieved with the use of a wrapped delegate that passes out the thread, to be killed, in a local variable inside the method that initiated it. The long running thread is cancelled by aborting it and control is returned to the main application. The following code sample provides a sample wrapper class around the Aspose.Email library. The code follows sample usage of the wrapper class as well.
