## **Working with Daily Recurrences**
Aspose.Email supports creation of daily recurrences using MapiCalendarDailyRecurrencePattern. Three different Mapi calendar recurrence end types can be used including EndAfterNOccurrences, EndAfterDate and NeverEnd. This section demonstrates the creation of different daily recurrence patterns.
### **Daily Recurrences: EndAfterNOccurrence Recurrance Type**
In this type of recurrence, number of recurrences is to be set along with other information as follows:

1. Set start, end and due date.
1. Create a MapiTask.
1. Set task state to NotAssigned.
1. Create the daily recurrence object by setting the properties like PatternType, Period, WeekStartDay, EndType and OccurenceCount.
1. Set MapiTask.Recurrence property to this daily recurrence object.
1. Save this message on disc.

The following code snippet shows you how to create task with recurrence end type as EndAfterNOccurrence.

### **Daily Recurrences: EndAfterDate Recurrance Type**
"End By" option in the Mapi Task is achieved by setting the OccurrenceCount property calculated by the GetOccurrenceCount() function. This function takes start date , end date and RRULE string.
#### **Daily Recurrences: Setting the Every Day value**
The following code snippet shows you how to set the period value to 1 and INTERVAL value to 1 in the RRULE string as well.

## **Generate Recurrence from Recurrence Rule**
Aspose.Email API provides the capability to generate Recurrence Pattern from Recurrence Rule (RRULE). It parses the information from the RRULE as per RFC 5545 iCal specifications and generates the recurrence pattern using the MapiCalendarRecurrencePatternFactory.FromString method. The following code snippet shows you how to generate recurrence pattern from recurrence rule.
