## **Creating, Saving and Reading Tasks**
Aspose.Email for .NET allows you to create Outlook tasks and save them to MSG format. The [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask) class provides a number of properties such as [PercentComplete](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/properties/percentcomplete), [EstimatedEffort](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/properties/estimatedeffort), [ActualEffort](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/properties/actualeffort), [History](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/properties/history), [LastUpdate](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask/properties/lastupdate), and others, to accommodate and set information required for an Outlook task. This article shows how to create, save and read a [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask) from disk. To create and save a task to disk:

1. Instantiate a new object of the [MapiContact](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapicontact) class.
1. Enter task property information.
1. Save the task to disc in MSG format.

The following code snippet shows you how to create, save and read Tasks.

### **Reading a MapiTask**
The [MapiContact](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapicontact) class object is used to cast the [MapiMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) object that loads a task from the disk as MSG format. The following code snippet shows you how to read a [MapiTask](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapitask).
