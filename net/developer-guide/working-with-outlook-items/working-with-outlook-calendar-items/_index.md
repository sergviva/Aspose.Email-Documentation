## **Setting Reminder with the Created Appointment**
A reminder can be added when an appointment is created. These alarms can trigger based on different criteria like n minutes before the schedule starts, repeat n times at n intervals.

There are a number of variants in which the reminder can be set on an appointment.

## **Convert Appointment EML to MSG with HTML Body**
Since version 19.3, Aspose.Email provides the ability to convert Appointment EML to MSG while retaining the HTML body of the appointment. Aspose.Email provides a [MapiConversionOptions.ForcedRtfBodyForAppointment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiconversionoptions/properties/forcedrtfbodyforappointment)[ ](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiconversionoptions/properties/forcedrtfbodyforappointment)property which has a default value of **true.** When the value of [MapiConversionOptions.ForcedRtfBodyForAppointment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiconversionoptions/properties/forcedrtfbodyforappointment) is set to **true**, the appointment body is converted to RTF format. To keep the appointment body format in HTML format, set the value of [MapiConversionOptions.ForcedRtfBodyForAppointment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiconversionoptions/properties/forcedrtfbodyforappointment) to **false.**

The following example demonstrates the use of [MapiConversionOptions.ForcedRtfBodyForAppointment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiconversionoptions/properties/forcedrtfbodyforappointment) property to keep the appointment body format in HTML format.
