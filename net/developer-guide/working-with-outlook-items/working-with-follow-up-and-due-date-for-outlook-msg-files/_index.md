## **Setting Follow Up and Due Date for Outlook MSG Files**
A follow-up flag marks an email message for some kind of action. Microsoft Outlook lets users flag messages and, in the flag set-up, assign a due date for the follow-up. Microsoft Outlook sends a reminder to the recipient to prompt them to follow up the email. Flagging emails and setting due dates programmatically lets software developers automate certain types of emails and help recipients remember to take action. For example, it could be used to send monthly messages to a sales team to remind them to complete their reports; or to send a message to all staff to remind them of a company meeting. Aspose.Email for .NET supports setting follow-up flag and due date for the [MapiMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) objects using [FollowUpManager](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/followupmanager) and [FollowUpOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/followupoptions). There are a number of variants in which the follow-up flag can be set on a message. They are all used in the code sample below:

1. Set a follow-up flag for a message
1. Add a due date and reminder date to a message
1. Add a flag to a recipient's message.
1. Mark as complete.
1. Remove flag.
1. Read follow up options.
