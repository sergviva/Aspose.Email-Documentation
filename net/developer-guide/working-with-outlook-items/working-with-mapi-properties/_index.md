## **Accessing and Setting Outlook MAPI Property**
The [MapiProperty](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiproperty) class represents a MAPI property, which contains:

- [Name](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiproperty/properties/name): a string that represents the property's name.
- [Tag](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiproperty/properties/tag): a long that represents the property's tag.
- [Data](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiproperty/properties/data): a byte array which represents the property's data.
### **Getting MAPI Property using the MAPI Property Tag**
To get MAPI properties:

1. Create an instance of [MapiMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) by [loading from files or stream](http://www.aspose.com/docs/display/emailnet/Managing+Message+Files+with+Aspose.Email.Outlook#ManagingMessageFileswithAspose.Email.Outlook-Loading%2CViewingandParsingMSGFile).
1. Get the [MapiProperty](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiproperty) from [MapiMessage.Properties](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiproperty/properties/index) by [MapiPropertyTag](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapipropertytag) keys.

## **Reading Named MAPI Properties from Outlook MSG Files**
Microsoft Outlook supports adding named MAPI properties to an MSG file. These named MAPI properties are added by the user. You can add a named property, for example, “MyProp”, to an MSG file using Aspose.Email. This article illustrates Aspose.Email's capabilities to:

- [Read Name MAPI Properties from an Outlook MSG file](#read-named-mapi-properties-from-msg-file)
- [Read Properties from Attachments](#reading-named-mapi-property-from-attachment)
- [Remove Properties from MSGs and Attachments](#remove-properties-from-msgs-and-attachments)
### **Read Named MAPI Properties from MSG file**
The following code snippet shows you how to read named MAPI properties from the MSG file.

### **Reading Named MAPI Property from Attachment**
Aspose.Email also allows you to traverse through the properties of a [MapiAttachment](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapiattachment) and search for a named property, in a way similar to the example above, for [MapiMessage](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage). The following code snippet shows you how to search for a named property through the attachment's property collection.

### **Remove Properties from MSGs and Attachments**
The following code snippet shows you how to remove properties from MSGs and attachments.
