## **Creating Voting Option Using MapiMessage**
Microsoft Outlook lets users create a poll when composing a new message. It lets them include voting options such as Yes, No, Maybe, etc. Aspose.Email allows the same while creating a new Outlook message. The [FollowUpOptions](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/followupoptions) class provides the [VotingButtons](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/followupoptions/properties/votingbuttons) property that can be used to set or get the value of voting options. This article provides a detailed example of creating a [MapiMesasge](https://apireference.aspose.com/net/email/aspose.email.mapi/mapimessage) with voting options for creating a poll.
