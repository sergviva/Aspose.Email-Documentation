## **Introduction**
Aspose .NET Gmail Sync for DNN is an open source module from [Aspose](http://www.aspose.com/) that links your DNN users to Google or Gmail contacts without requiring any other software. It uses the powerful features of [Aspose.Email for .NET](http://www.aspose.com/.net/email-component.aspx) to allow you to easily sync your Gmail contacts and DNN users. The contact details from Gmail and DNN user profiles are smartly mapped so that all the information associated with a DNN user or Gmail contact is migrated properly from one system to the other.
### **Module Features**
This initial version of the module is enriched with the following cool features to make the sync process effective, simple and easy to use.

- Google/Gmail server credentials are encrypted and saved in the database so that you don’t have to enter them every time you use the module.
- Sync all or selected Gmail contacts to DNN and vice versa.
- Option to select one or more DNN roles when performing Gmail to DNN sync.
- Existence of every contact/user in the destination system is checked before migration to make sure that the sync does not create duplicate records.
- The contacts migrated to Gmail are put in Other Contacts group so that you can verify and move only required ones to My Contacts.
- A brief summary of the sync process is shown upon completion.
