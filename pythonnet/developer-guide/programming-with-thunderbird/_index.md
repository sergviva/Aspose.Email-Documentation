## **Reading Messages**
Mozilla Thunderbird is an open source, cross-platform email client, developed by the Mozilla Foundation. It stores emails in its own file structure, managing messages indices and subfolders through proprietary file formats. Aspose.Email can work with Thunderbird mail storage structures. The MboxrdStorageReader class lets developers read messages from Mozilla Thunderbird’s mail storage file. This article shows how to read the messages from Thunderbird email storage:

1. Open the Thunderbird’s storage file
1. Create an instance of the MboxrdStorageReader class and pass the above stream to the constructor.
1. Call read_next_message() to get the first message.
1. Use the same read_next_message() in a while loop to read all the messages.
1. Close all the streams.

The following code snippet shows you how to read all the messages from a Thunderbird mail storage.
